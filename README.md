# 👨‍💻 Compilerless Vue component dev 🛠️
Just testing out how I could potentially build with fully contained components (structure + logic + style) without needed to use a compiler.

### Why I don't like compiling frontend stuff
- I want to build with Vue without needed to set up loads of stuff on my local machine and have all different kinds of tool running. 
- I want to be able to rip the source code directly from where ever it's hosted and make changes and save the code back.
- I want simple.

### Why I don't just write it all in one html page
- I do prefer to do that for small apps
- But for bigger apps separate fully contained files would be nice
- Also I build similar functionality alot so component reuse would be ideal without having to copy over massive CSS files (that's why I've went a bit over board trying to get CSS in the js files.)
